ANalise e entenda a aplicação. Principalmente a estrutura do banco de dados, suas tabelas e colunas, relacionamentos. POsteriormente vou pedir uma ajuda.

> Copilot: I'll analyze and help you understand this application, focusing on the database structure, tables, columns, and relationships.
> 
> Looking at the code, this appears to be a system for managing legal processes and procedures, with user management functionality. Let me break down the database structure for you.
> 
> ## Database Structure
> 
> The application uses SQLite for data storage, with the database file located at usuarios.db in the current directory during development.
> 
> ### Main Tables
> 
> 1. **`encarregados` (In charge/Responsible Officers)**
>    - Primary key: `id` (UUID)
>    - Fields: `posto_graduacao` (rank), `matricula` (registration number), `nome` (name), `email` (optional), timestamps, and `ativo` (active status)
> 
> 2. **`operadores` (Operators/System Users)**
>    - Primary key: `id` (UUID)
>    - Fields: `posto_graduacao` (rank), `matricula` (registration number), `nome` (name), `email`, `senha` (password), `profile` (admin or comum/regular), timestamps, and `ativo` (active status)
> 
> 3. **`processos_procedimentos` (Processes/Procedures)**
>    - Primary key: `id` (UUID)
>    - Fields:
>      - `numero` (unique number)
>      - `tipo_geral` ('processo' or 'procedimento')
>      - `tipo_detalhe` (specific type of process)
>      - `documento_iniciador` (initiating document - restricted to 'Portaria', 'Memorando Disciplinar', or 'Feito Preliminar')
>      - `processo_sei` (SEI process number)
>      - `responsavel_id` and `responsavel_tipo` (responsible person and their type - 'encarregado' or 'operador')
>      - `local_origem` (origin location)
>      - Various dates: `data_instauracao`, `data_recebimento`
>      - Various officer IDs: `escrivao_id`, `nome_pm_id`
>      - Process details: `status_pm`, `nome_vitima`, `natureza_processo`, `natureza_procedimento`, `resumo_fatos`
>      - Document numbers: `numero_portaria`, `numero_memorando`, `numero_feito`, `numero_rgf`
>      - Timestamps and `ativo` (active status)
> 
> 4. **Additional tables related to deadlines and progress tracking** (referenced in the code but not directly defined in the visible part):
>    - The code imports a `PrazosAndamentosManager` class, which likely manages tables for deadlines and process progress.
>    - There are functions for setting deadlines (`definir_prazo_processo`), extending deadlines (`prorrogar_prazo_processo`), and registering progress updates (`registrar_andamento_processo`).
> 
> ### Relationships
> 
> 1. **Users and Processes**:
>    - `processos_procedimentos.responsavel_id` links to either `operadores.id` or `encarregados.id` (determined by `responsavel_tipo`)
>    - `processos_procedimentos.escrivao_id` likely links to a user
>    - `processos_procedimentos.nome_pm_id` links to either an operator or a responsible officer
> 
> 2. **Process Deadlines and Progress**:
>    - Not explicitly defined in the visible code, but functions suggest relationships between processes and their deadlines/progress updates
> 
> ### Key Features of the Database
> 
> 1. **User Authentication**: The system supports login for both operators (with password) and responsible officers (without password, email-only authentication).
> 
> 2. **Process Management**: Comprehensive tracking of legal processes with various attributes.
> 
> 3. **Deadline Calculation**: The system automatically calculates deadlines based on process type and initial dates.
> 
> 4. **Audit Trail**: The database has timestamps for creation and updates, and maintains active status flags instead of deleting records.
> 
> 5. **Data Validation**: Several fields have constraints (CHECK constraints in SQL) to ensure valid values.
> 
> The system appears to be a legal process management application, likely for a police or military organization (given terms like "posto_graduacao" and references to "PM" which could refer to "Polícia Militar" in Brazil).
> 
> Let me know what specific aspects of the database or application you'd like to explore further, and I'll be happy to help!

Agora verifique o backend como esta implementado e suas funções.

> Copilot: I'll analyze the backend implementation and its functions to give you a comprehensive overview of how the application works.

> - User authentication and management (encarregados/operadores)
> - Process/procedure registration and management
> - Basic statistics and data retrieval
> 
> ### 2. Deadlines and Progress Management (prazos_andamentos_manager.py)
> 
> The `PrazosAndamentosManager` class is specialized for tracking deadlines and progress:
> - Deadline management (setting, extending, completing)
> - Process progress tracking (adding and listing progress updates)
> - Status management and history
> - Reporting and dashboard data
> 
> ### 3. Migration System (migration_runner.py)
> 
> The `MigrationRunner` class manages database schema migrations:

> - Handles schema versioning
> 
> ### 4. Backup System (backup_manager.py)
> 
> The `BackupManager` class handles database backups:
> - Creates automated and manual backups
> - Maintains backup history
> - Manages backup rotation (keeps only a certain number of backups)
> 
> ### 5. Security Enhancements (referenced, but not fully visible)
> 
> Based on filenames, there appears to be security enhancements, but the details aren't visible in the code I examined.
> 
> ## Key Backend Functions
> 
> ### User Management
> 
> 1. **Authentication**: `verify_login()` in DatabaseManager
>    - Supports both operator and responsible officer logins
>    - Password hashing for operators
> 
> 2. **User CRUD Operations**:
>    - `add_operador()`, `add_encarregado()` - Create users
>    - `update_user()` - Update user information
>    - `delete_user()` - Soft delete users (marking inactive)
>    - `get_paginated_users()` - List users with pagination and search
> 
> ### Process/Procedure Management
> 
> 1. **Process CRUD Operations**:
>    - `registrar_processo()` - Register new processes
>    - `obter_processo()` - Get process details
>    - `atualizar_processo()` - Update process information
>    - `excluir_processo()` - Soft delete processes

>    - `atualizar_status_detalhado_processo()` - Update detailed status
> 
> ### Reporting and Analytics
> 
> 1. **Deadline Monitoring**:
>    - `obter_prazos_vencendo()` - Get approaching deadlines
>    - `obter_prazos_vencidos()` - Get overdue deadlines
>    - `obter_dashboard_prazos()` - Get dashboard data for deadlines
> 
> 2. **Reports**:
>    - `gerar_relatorio_processo()` - Generate process reports
>    - `gerar_relatorio_prazos()` - Generate deadline reports
>    - `relatorio_processos_por_prazo()` - Report processes by deadline status
>    - `relatorio_andamentos_por_periodo()` - Report progress by time period
> 
> ## Database Structure (Additional Tables)
> 
> From the migration file (005_add_prazos_andamentos.sql), I can see additional tables not previously visible:
> 
> 1. **`prazos_processo`**:
>    - Tracks deadlines for processes
>    - Fields: process ID, deadline type, start/end dates, days added, reason, authorization
> 
> 2. **`andamentos_processo`**:
>    - Tracks progress updates for processes
>    - Fields: process ID, date, update type, description, origin/destination, responsible user
> 
> 3. **`status_detalhado_processo`**:
>    - Provides detailed status tracking for processes
>    - Fields: process ID, status code, change date, responsible user, observations
> 
> 4. **Views**:
>    - `v_processos_com_prazo` - Processes with deadlines
>    - `v_ultimo_andamento` - Latest progress update for each process
> 
> 5. **Triggers**:
>    - Audit triggers for tracking changes to deadlines and progress
> 
> ## Frontend Integration
> 
> The backend connects to the frontend through Eel, a Python library that exposes Python functions to JavaScript:
> - All backend functions with `@eel.expose` can be called from the frontend
> - The frontend uses these functions to fetch data and perform operations
> 
> ## Execution Flow
> 
> 1. start_app.py is the entry point
> 2. It loads main.py, which initializes the core components
> 3. main.py initializes the database, prazos manager, and starts the web interface
> 4. Eel bridges the gap between the Python backend and HTML/JS frontend
> 
> This architecture provides a complete system for managing legal processes, with user authentication, comprehensive process tracking, deadline management, and reporting capabilities.

Agora analise o frontend.

> Copilot: I'll analyze the frontend implementation of the application. Let me examine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to understand the user interface structure and functionality. Let me check the static directory: Now, let's examine the CSS files: Let's look at the JavaScript files: Now, let's examine the key pages of the frontend, starting with the login page: Let's check the dashboard page: Let's check the procedure list page: Let's examine the JavaScript that handles the procedure list: Let's examine the procedure form: Let's check the JavaScript file for the procedure form: Now, let's check the login JavaScript: Let's look at the CSS styling: Let's examine the styles for the login page: Let's check the CSS for procedures: Based on my analysis of the frontend implementation, here's a comprehensive overview:
> 
> ## Frontend Architecture
> 
> The application is built with a traditional web frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with the Python backend via Eel, which provides a bridge for calling Python functions from JavaScript.
> 
> ### Key Components
> 
> 1. **Page Structure**
>    - **Login Page**: User authentication interface
>    - **Dashboard**: Main navigation hub with access to system modules
>    - **User Management**: List and form pages for managing users
>    - **Process/Procedure Management**: List and form pages for managing legal processes
> 
> 2. **UI Design**
>    - Modern, responsive design with gradient colors and soft shadows
>    - Consistent header across authenticated pages with user info and logout button
>    - Card-based navigation in the dashboard
>    - Tabular views for listing data with filtering and pagination
>    - Modal dialogs for confirmations and notifications
> 
> 3. **Integration with Backend**
>    - Uses Eel.js (`/eel.js`) to call Python backend functions
>    - All backend functions exposed with `@eel.expose` are accessible from frontend
>    - Asynchronous communication with Promise-based calls
> 
> ## Key Frontend Features
> 
> ### 1. Authentication System
> 
> - Login form with username/password fields
> - Session management (checking logged-in state on page load)
> - Redirection to login page when session expires
> - User profile display in header with role-based access
> 
> ### 2. User Management
> 
> - List view with search, filtering, and pagination
> - User form for adding/editing users
> - Role-based forms (different fields for operators vs. responsible officers)
> - Confirmation dialogs for delete actions
> 
> ### 3. Process/Procedure Management
> 
> - Comprehensive form with dynamic field visibility based on selected type
> - Advanced filtering system with multiple criteria
> - Status indicators with color-coding and animations for deadlines
> - Detailed view of processes with associated deadlines and progress updates
> 
> ### 4. Interactive UI Elements
> 
> - Modal dialogs for confirmations and notifications
> - Form validation with error messages
> - Loading indicators during async operations
> - Responsive design that works across different screen sizes
> - Visual feedback for user actions (success/error alerts)
> 
> ## Frontend JavaScript Architecture
> 
> The JavaScript code follows a structured approach:
> 
> 1. **Page Initialization**
>    - Load user data and verify authentication
>    - Set up event listeners
>    - Initialize form state for edit operations
> 
> 2. **Data Management**
>    - Fetch data from backend (users, processes, etc.)
>    - Client-side filtering and pagination
>    - Form data validation and submission
> 
> 3. **UI Interaction**
>    - Modal dialogs for user confirmations
>    - Dynamic form field visibility based on selections
>    - Status indicators and visual feedback
> 
> 4. **Utilities**
>    - Alert/notification system
>    - Loading state management
>    - Date formatting and calculations
> 
> ## CSS Implementation
> 
> The styling is organized into multiple CSS files:
> 
> 1. **Base Styles (dashboard.css)**
>    - Common layout elements (header, cards)
>    - Basic typography and color scheme
>    - Responsive design rules
> 
> 2. **Module-Specific Styles**
>    - login.css - Styling for the login page
>    - `users.css` - User management specific styles
>    - procedures.css - Process management specific styles
>    - `processes.css` - Additional styles for process forms
> 
> 3. **Visual Elements**
>    - Status indicators with color coding
>    - Form styling with consistent input appearance
>    - Animation effects for interactive elements
>    - Modal dialog styling
> 
> ## Integration with Eel
> 
> The frontend communicates with the Python backend through Eel:
> 
> ```javascript
> // Example: Fetch processes
> async function carregarProcessos() {
>     const processos = await eel.listar_processos()();
>     // Process data and update UI
> }
> 
> // Example: Submit form
> async function salvarProcesso(formData) {
>     const resultado = await eel.registrar_processo(
>         formData.numero, 
>         formData.tipo_geral,
>         // ...other fields
>     )();
>     
>     if (resultado.sucesso) {
>         showAlert(resultado.mensagem, 'success');
>         // Redirect or other success action
>     } else {
>         showAlert(resultado.mensagem, 'error');
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> ## Frontend Design Patterns
> 
> 1. **Asynchronous Operations**
>    - All backend calls are async/await based
>    - Loading indicators during pending operations
> 
> 2. **Component-Based Structure**
>    - Modular HTML with reusable components
>    - Shared styles across pages
> 
> 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
>    - Event listeners for user interactions
>    - Form validation on input changes and submission
> 
> 4. **Client-Side Filtering & Pagination**
>    - Data manipulation happens client-side for better UX
>    - Pagination implemented in JavaScript
> 
> The frontend design is clean, modern, and focused on usability, with careful attention to visual cues for deadlines and status indicators. The integration with the Python backend via Eel provides a seamless experience despite the technology gap between the Python backend and JavaScript frontend.
